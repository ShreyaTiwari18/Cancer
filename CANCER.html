<h2>
<p>In India, the incidence of cancer is increasing rapidly                                                                          
therefore it is important to step up cancer literacy and
knowledge amongst the population.                                 

We hope that this will lead to early detection which is
important in the management and treatment of cancer and
also prevention by making necessary changes in lifestyle. </p>   <img src="https://www.indiancancersociety.org/what-do-we-do/images/cancer-awareness-campaign-2019.png" align="right" width="600" height="400">

                                                                             which requires surgery and extensive treatment.
                                                                             If detected early, then in most cases there will be less aggressive treatment and better
